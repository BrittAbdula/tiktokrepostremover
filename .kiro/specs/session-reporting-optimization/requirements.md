# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The TikTok Repost Remover extension currently reports too much session data to the backend API, creating unnecessary network traffic and data overhead. This optimization aims to streamline the reporting to only capture essential user journey milestones and key performance metrics, reducing API calls while maintaining valuable analytics insights.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to reduce unnecessary API calls from the extension, so that server load and bandwidth usage are minimized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension runs THEN the total number of API calls SHALL be reduced by at least 70% compared to current implementation
2. WHEN a user session starts THEN only one session creation API call SHALL be made
3. WHEN the removal process is running THEN periodic updates SHALL be limited to maximum once every 30 seconds instead of every 10 seconds
4. WHEN the process completes THEN only one final session update SHALL be sent with completion data

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want to maintain visibility into key user journey events, so that I can still analyze user behavior and success rates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs into TikTok THEN the system SHALL report login status change
2. WHEN the removal process starts THEN the system SHALL report process initiation with total reposts found
3. WHEN the removal process completes THEN the system SHALL report final results including success/failure counts and duration
4. WHEN a user pauses/resumes the process THEN the system SHALL report state changes
5. WHEN critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL report error events with context

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to eliminate redundant and low-value data points, so that the codebase is cleaner and more maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN individual video processing occurs THEN the system SHALL NOT report each video removal individually
2. WHEN progress updates happen THEN the system SHALL NOT send real-time progress updates to the API
3. WHEN waiting/countdown events occur THEN the system SHALL NOT report these temporary states
4. WHEN duplicate messages are detected THEN the system SHALL prevent redundant API calls
5. WHEN session data hasn't changed significantly THEN the system SHALL skip unnecessary updates

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the extension to perform efficiently without impacting my browsing experience, so that the removal process runs smoothly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension is running THEN network requests SHALL NOT cause noticeable performance degradation
2. WHEN API calls fail THEN the extension SHALL continue functioning without blocking the user interface
3. WHEN the removal process is active THEN background API calls SHALL be throttled to prevent overwhelming the browser
4. WHEN multiple instances run simultaneously THEN duplicate session reporting SHALL be prevented

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a product manager, I want to retain essential metrics for business intelligence, so that I can make data-driven decisions about the product.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a session completes THEN the system SHALL report total processing time, success rate, and user engagement metrics
2. WHEN users encounter errors THEN the system SHALL report error types and frequencies for debugging
3. WHEN users pause/abandon the process THEN the system SHALL report abandonment points and reasons
4. WHEN login issues occur THEN the system SHALL report authentication problems for user support
5. WHEN the process succeeds THEN the system SHALL report completion metrics for success tracking
