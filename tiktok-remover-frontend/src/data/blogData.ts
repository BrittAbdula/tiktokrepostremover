Have you ever looked at your TikTok profile and wished you could just hit one button to clear out all those reposts? You're not alone! Many users want a quick way to clean up their feed. This guide will walk you through the current options for deleting reposts on TikTok, including how to request a bulk deletion feature and the methods available right now.

It's important to note upfront that **at the time of recording and based on the latest information, TikTok does not currently offer a direct feature to delete all your reposts at once**. However, there are steps you can take to manage your reposts and even let TikTok know you'd like a bulk deletion option!

## Method 1: Requesting a Bulk Delete Feature Through TikTok Support

Since a "delete all" button doesn't exist yet, the best approach is to communicate directly with TikTok's support team. This allows you to provide feedback and request the feature you'd like to see.

Here's how to contact TikTok support to request a bulk deletion feature:

1. **Open the TikTok App** on your device.
2. **Go to Your Profile:** Tap the **"Profile" button** located in the bottom right corner of the screen.
3. **Access Settings:** Look for the **three horizontal lines (or menu icon)** in the top right corner of your profile page and tap on them.
4. **Select "Settings and privacy"** from the pop-up menu.
5. **Navigate to Support:** Scroll down until you find the **"Support and about" section**. Alternatively, some guides suggest finding just "Support" and then "Help Center".
6. **Tap on "Report a problem"**.
7. **Choose a Topic (or the Online Form):**
   - **Option A (General Feedback):** You can **select any topic** (it doesn't really matter which one) to proceed to the feedback section. Some users might select a more suitable topic like "Feed and Playback" and then "Feed" or "Other".
   - **Option B (Specific Reporting Form):** Another method involves scrolling down to find the **"Online reporting form"** within the "Report a problem" section.
8. **Provide Your Feedback:**
   - **If you chose Option A:** Scroll to the bottom of the screen where it asks "Is your problem resolved?" and **tap the "thumbs down" / "No" button**. This will reveal an option labeled **"Need more help." Press this button**. You'll then be taken to the TikTok help desk where you can **write a message** politely requesting assistance with deleting all your reposts, for example, "Hi please can you help me to delete all my reposts thanks" or "I want to delete all my reposts". Finally, **click on "Send"**.
   - **If you chose Option B:** Tap on the dropdown in the "Topic" section and **select "General account inquiry,"** then choose "Other" for the category. **Enter your username and the contact email** that TikTok support will use to get back to you. In the "Additional details" section, **type your request**, for instance, "Hi Tik Tok support I would like to request the deletion of all my reposts". You can also add more details, like wanting to make your account look clean. You can also upload attachments if needed.
9. **Submit Your Request:** If using the online form, **tap on the tick boxes** and then **hit "Submit"**.
10. **Wait for a Response:** TikTok's support team will receive your message. They typically acknowledge your feedback for removing reposts in bulk and indicate they are considering it for future improvements. If you used the online reporting form, **expect to wait 24 to 48 hours** for TikTok support to get back to you via the email you provided.

**Important Note:** While TikTok will acknowledge your request for a bulk deletion feature, they will likely still provide you with instructions on **how to delete reposts manually, one by one**, as this is the current functionality.

## Method 2: Deleting Reposts One by One (The Current Manual Solution)

Currently, the only way to delete reposts is to do so individually. This can be time-consuming if you have many, but it is the method TikTok provides.

To remove a single reposted video:

1. **Navigate to the reposted video** you wish to delete.
2. **Tap the "share" button**.
3. **Select the "Remove repost" option**.

You will need to repeat this process for each reposted video you want to remove.
