Have you ever looked at your TikTok profile and wished you could just hit one button to clear out all those reposts? You're not alone! Many users want a quick way to clean up their feed. This guide will walk you through the current options for deleting reposts on TikTok, including how to request a bulk deletion feature and the methods available right now.

It's important to note upfront that **at the time of recording and based on the latest information, TikTok does not currently offer a direct feature to delete all your reposts at once**. However, there are steps you can take to manage your reposts and even let TikTok know you'd like a bulk deletion option!

## Method 1: Requesting a Bulk Delete Feature Through TikTok Support

Since a "delete all" button doesn't exist yet, the best approach is to communicate directly with TikTok's support team. This allows you to provide feedback and request the feature you'd like to see.

![TikTok Official Deletion Process](/images/blog/how-to-delete-all-reposts-on-tiktok.png)

Here's how to contact TikTok support to request a bulk deletion feature:

1. **Open the TikTok App** on your device.
2. **Go to Your Profile:** Tap the **"Profile" button** located in the bottom right corner of the screen.
3. **Access Settings:** Look for the **three horizontal lines (or menu icon)** in the top right corner of your profile page and tap on them.
4. **Select "Settings and privacy"** from the pop-up menu.
5. **Navigate to Support:** Scroll down until you find the **"Support and about" section**. Alternatively, some guides suggest finding just "Support" and then "Help Center".
6. **Tap on "Report a problem"**.
7. **Choose a Topic (or the Online Form):**

    - **Option A (General Feedback):** You can **select any topic** (it doesn't really matter which one) to proceed to the feedback section. Some users might select a more suitable topic like "Feed and Playback" and then "Feed" or "Other".
    - **Option B (Specific Reporting Form):** Another method involves scrolling down to find the **"Online reporting form"** within the "Report a problem" section.
8. **Provide Your Feedback:**

    - **If you chose Option A:** Scroll to the bottom of the screen where it asks "Is your problem resolved?" and **tap the "thumbs down" / "No" button**. This will reveal an option labeled **"Need more help." Press this button**. You'll then be taken to the TikTok help desk where you can **write a message** politely requesting assistance with deleting all your reposts, for example, "Hi please can you help me to delete all my reposts thanks" or "I want to delete all my reposts". Finally, **click on "Send"**.
    - **If you chose Option B:** Tap on the dropdown in the "Topic" section and **select "General account inquiry,"** then choose "Other" for the category. **Enter your username and the contact email** that TikTok support will use to get back to you. In the "Additional details" section, **type your request**, for instance, "Hi Tik Tok support I would like to request the deletion of all my reposts". You can also add more details, like wanting to make your account look clean. You can also upload attachments if needed.
9. **Submit Your Request:** If using the online form, **tap on the tick boxes** and then **hit "Submit"**.
10. **Wait for a Response:** TikTok's support team will receive your message. They typically acknowledge your feedback for removing reposts in bulk and indicate they are considering it for future improvements. If you used the online reporting form, **expect to wait 24 to 48 hours** for TikTok support to get back to you via the email you provided.

**Important Note:** While TikTok will acknowledge your request for a bulk deletion feature, they will likely still provide you with instructions on **how to delete reposts manually, one by one**, as this is the current functionality.

This step-by-step video demonstrates both the manual TikTok support method and shows you exactly how ClearTok can automate the entire process for you.

## Method 2: Deleting Reposts One by One (The Current Manual Solution)

Currently, the only way to delete reposts is to do so individually. This can be time-consuming if you have many, but it is the method TikTok provides.

To remove a single reposted video:

1. **Navigate to the reposted video** you wish to delete.
2. **Tap the "share" button**.
3. **Select the "Remove repost" option**.

You will need to repeat this process for each reposted video you want to remove.

Managing your digital footprint on TikTok is more than routine housekeeping—it's a strategic act of personal brand management. From curating first impressions to aligning with a professional narrative, here are the most persuasive reasons to wipe the slate clean and remove old reposts.

![Curating Your Image](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1517841905240-472988babdf9?auto=format&fit=crop&w=1350&q=80)

### 1. Social & First-Impression Engineering
When you connect with new friends—whether future employers, collaborators, or even potential romantic interests—your profile is often the first handshake. Out-of-context or questionable reposts can instantly undermine the story you want to tell about yourself. A refined repost history ensures every visitor sees the version of you that *you* designed.

### 2. Evolving Taste & Identity
What made you laugh two years ago might make you cringe today. Your interests, worldview, and sensibilities evolve, and so should your feed. Clearing away content that no longer resonates keeps your online persona in sync with who you are **right now**.

![Evolving Identity](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1529626455594-4ff0802cfb7e?auto=format&fit=crop&w=1350&q=80)

### 3. Fixing Accidental Reposts
TikTok's share UI places the repost button perilously close to other actions, so accidental taps happen more often than you think. Removing reposts gives you an easy reset when a slip-of-the-thumb broadcasts something you never intended to share.

### 4. Professional & Brand Consistency
Creators, entrepreneurs, and job-seekers use TikTok as a living portfolio. Random memes or off-brand reposts dilute that message and confuse your audience. Scrubbing your repost history keeps your feed laser-focused on the niche you serve and the values you stand for.

![Professional Brand](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1504384308090-c894fdcc538d?auto=format&fit=crop&w=1350&q=80)

### 5. Digital Minimalism
Some users simply crave a clutter-free profile. A pared-down repost list means faster load times, a more intentional grid, and a calmer experience each time you open the app.

## The Fast Way to Start Fresh
If the idea of manually deleting dozens—or hundreds—of reposts sounds daunting, tools like **ClearTok** can automate the process in minutes while keeping your data private.

> A polished profile isn't vanity—it's strategy.

Whenever friends ask *"Hey, where do my reposts go?"* I always smile—because finding them is one of TikTok's hidden-in-plain-sight tricks. Let me walk you through how **I** check my own reposts (and sneak-peek other people's) in 2025.

![Repost Tab Banner](/images/blog/tiktok-repost-tab-banner.png)

## Why I Bother Checking My Reposts

Over time my sense of humor changes, old memes die, and sometimes I just repost on impulse. Popping into the Repost tab every couple of weeks helps me:

• Keep my profile vibe on-brand.
• Delete anything that aged like milk.
• See which shares actually sparked conversations.

## My Two-Second Routine to See *My* Reposts

1. **Open TikTok** (obvious, I know).  
2. Tap **Profile** in the bottom-right.  
3. Spot the **two-arrow icon** (↻) sitting under the bio—right beside the "private" and "liked" tabs.  
4. Tap it and—boom—every video I've ever reposted lines up in reverse order.

![Two Arrows Icon](/images/blog/tiktok-two-arrows-icon.png)

If that space reads *"No videos reposted,"* congrats—you're squeaky clean (for now). 

## Peeking at Someone Else's Reposts

Curious what a favorite creator is boosting? I just open their **Profile**, hunt for the same ↻ icon, and tap. If the icon's missing, they either haven't reposted anything **or** their account is private and I'm not on the friends list yet.

> **Heads-up:** TikTok still won't tell me who reposted *my* videos. The only workaround is manual detective work on individual profiles.

## 2025 Repost Facts I Keep in Mind

• **Visibility:** Every repost I make jumps into my followers' FYP, just like an original upload.  
• **Credit Stays Intact:** The original creator's @ remains front and center.  
• **Repost to Story:** I can also flick a video straight to my 24-hour Story—totally separate from the regular repost tab.  
• **One-Tap Undo:** Changed my mind? I open the video, hit **Share → Remove repost**, and it vanishes instantly.

![Clean Feed](/images/blog/tiktok-clean-feed.png)

**Pro Tip:** If you're staring at hundreds of old shares (been there!), fire up **ClearTok** and let it bulk-delete while you sip coffee.

Happy scrolling—and cleaner reposting!  

---

## Extra Tips & FAQs (2025)

**Why can't I see the two-arrow icon?**  
1. Double-check that you're on the **latest TikTok version** in the App Store / Google Play.  
2. Clear your app cache (Profile → ☰ → Settings & privacy → Free up space).  
3. Log out and back in—sometimes a simple refresh forces the feature to appear.  

**Does deleting a repost hurt the algorithm?**  
Not really. TikTok only removes the signal that *you* boosted the clip. The original upload keeps its momentum.

**I run a brand account—how often should I audit reposts?**  
I keep a **monthly calendar reminder**. Anything off-brand gets axed, and evergreen gems stay.

## Advanced Clean-Up Workflow

1. Export your repost list with **ClearTok's CSV feature** for record-keeping.  
2. Tag each link "keep" or "delete" in Google Sheets.  
3. Import the "delete" list back into ClearTok and let it run.  

This way I only spend *minutes* instead of hours tapping around the app.

### Key Takeaway

Staying intentional with reposts keeps my profile fresh and on-brand—plus it's a quick win for the almighty algorithm.

We've all done it—late-night scrolling, thumb slips, and suddenly I've shared a video I'm *not* ready to endorse. Luckily, unreposting in 2025 is still a breeze, and I'll show you my two favorite "oops-proof" methods.

![Remove Repost Banner](/images/blog/remove-repost-banner.png)

## Method 1: The Classic Share-Button Fix

1. **Find the video** (I usually hop into my Reposts tab ↻).  
2. Tap **Share** (that right-facing arrow).  
3. Smash **Remove repost**.  
4. A toast pops up—*poof*, it's gone.

![Remove Repost Button](/images/blog/remove-repost-button.png)

## Method 2: Press-and-Hold Ninja Move

When I'm in a hurry, I just long-press the video thumbnail inside the Reposts tab. A micro-menu appears with **Remove repost**—one tap and done.

## What Actually Changes When I Unrepost?

• My followers stop seeing that video in their FYP.  
• Any likes/comments tied to *my* share disappear.  
• The **original** upload is untouched.  
• I can always repost it again later—no penalties.

## Why TikTok Still Makes Me Delete One-by-One

As of 2025 there's **no native "Delete All Reposts"** button (annoying, I know). If I'm spring-cleaning dozens of shares, I outsource the grunt work to **ClearTok** and let it auto-tap while I cook dinner.

![ClearTok Progress](/images/blog/cleartok-progress.png)

## Repost vs. Stitch vs. Duet (Quick Refresher)

- **Repost** — Boost a video directly to my feed and my followers' FYP.
- **Stitch** — Clip up to 5 seconds of an existing video into my own.
- **Duet** — Record my reaction side-by-side with the original.


## Final Take

Keeping my profile tidy feels refreshing—and now you know my secret shortcuts. The next time you repost in error, breathe easy and remove it in seconds.

---

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Will the creator know I removed my repost?**  
A: Nope. TikTok keeps that silent.

**Q: Does unreposting affect the original video's stats?**  
A: The original still holds all likes, comments, and shares from everyone else—including any your followers left on the *original* upload.

**Q: Can I delete a Story repost the same way?**  
A: Yes—open the Story reel, tap the three-dot menu, and hit **Delete**.

## Safety & Privacy Considerations

• Stick to the official TikTok app when unreposting—shady modded clients can expose your account.  
• Avoid spam-tapping; rapid actions can trigger temporary rate limits (I keep it to ~100 removals per hour).

## Beyond Manual: Scaling with Automation

For creators with **thousands** of reposts, manual removal is a slog. **ClearTok** mimics human pace with randomized delays, staying under TikTok's radar while wiping your feed clean. I've personally cleared 3,000+ reposts in an afternoon—zero bans, zero headaches.

---

### Final Words

Curating isn't about perfection—it's about authenticity. Keep what reflects *you* today, archive the rest, and let your TikTok presence evolve confidently.

    slug: "cleartok-now-supports-microsoft-edge",
    excerpt: "We're excited to announce that ClearTok is now available on Microsoft Edge! This expansion means more TikTok users can access our powerful repost removal tool, regardless of their preferred browser.",
    content: `
We're thrilled to share some exciting news with our ClearTok community! After receiving countless requests from Edge users, we're proud to announce that **ClearTok is now officially available on [Microsoft Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/cleartok-tiktok-repost-/bgbcmapbnbdmmjibajjagnlbbdhcenoc)**.

![ClearTok Edge Support](/images/blog/cleartok-edge-support.png)

## Why We Decided to Support Microsoft Edge

When we first launched ClearTok, we focused on Chrome because it was the most popular browser among our target users. However, as our user base grew, we started receiving more and more messages like:

*"I love ClearTok's concept, but I use Edge as my primary browser. Any plans to support it?"*
*"Edge is my go-to browser for work and personal use. Would be amazing to have ClearTok there too!"*
*"I switched to Edge for better performance, but I miss having ClearTok available."*

These requests made us realize that browser choice is deeply personal and often tied to specific workflows, security preferences, or performance needs. By limiting ClearTok to just Chrome, we were unintentionally excluding a significant portion of users who could benefit from our tool.

## The Technical Journey

Adding Edge support wasn't just about copying our Chrome extension. Microsoft Edge has its own unique architecture and requirements. Here's what the process involved:

### 1. **Extension Manifest Updates**
Edge uses a different manifest structure than Chrome, requiring us to update our extension configuration to meet Microsoft's specific requirements.

### 2. **API Compatibility**
While Edge is built on Chromium (like Chrome), there are subtle differences in how certain APIs work. We had to test and adjust our code to ensure seamless functionality across both platforms.

### 3. **Security & Privacy Standards**
Microsoft has its own security review process. We worked closely with their team to ensure ClearTok meets Edge's privacy and security standards while maintaining our core promise: **your data never leaves your browser**.

### 4. **Performance Optimization**
Edge users often choose the browser for its performance benefits. We optimized ClearTok to work efficiently within Edge's architecture, ensuring the same fast, reliable experience users expect.

## What This Means for Edge Users

### **Same Powerful Features**
Edge users now have access to all the features that made ClearTok popular on Chrome:
- 🚀 **One-click bulk repost removal**
- ⚡ **Fast processing with human-like delays**
- 🔒 **Complete privacy - no data stored**
- 📊 **Real-time progress tracking**
- 💾 **Export functionality for record keeping**

### **Seamless Integration**
The Edge version works exactly like the Chrome version:
1. Install from the [Microsoft Edge Add-ons Store](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/cleartok-tiktok-repost-/bgbcmapbnbdmmjibajjagnlbbdhcenoc)
2. Sign into TikTok.com in Edge
3. Click the ClearTok icon and start removing reposts
4. Watch your profile clean up in real-time

### **Trusted by Microsoft**
Being available on the official Microsoft Edge Add-ons Store means ClearTok has passed Microsoft's security and quality standards. Users can install with confidence knowing it's been vetted by Microsoft's team.

## Our Commitment to Cross-Platform Support

This expansion represents our broader commitment to making TikTok profile management accessible to everyone, regardless of their browser preference. We believe that tools like ClearTok should work with your existing workflow, not force you to change your habits.

### **What's Next?**
While we're excited about Edge support, we're not stopping here. We're actively exploring support for other popular browsers based on user demand. Your feedback continues to drive our development priorities.

## Real User Impact

Since launching on Edge, we've already received heartwarming feedback:

> *"Finally! I've been waiting for this. Edge is my daily driver and now I can clean up my TikTok without switching browsers."* - Sarah M.

> *"The Edge version works perfectly. Same great experience as Chrome, but now I can use it in my preferred browser."* - Mike R.

> *"Thank you for listening to Edge users. This makes such a difference for my workflow."* - Jennifer L.

## How to Get Started on Edge

### **For New Users:**

2. Click "Get" to install ClearTok
3. Open TikTok.com in Edge
4. Click the ClearTok icon in your toolbar
5. Start cleaning your profile!

### **For Existing Chrome Users:**
If you're already using ClearTok on Chrome, you can also install it on Edge. Your settings and preferences will be separate, but the experience will be identical.

## Behind the Scenes: Our Development Philosophy

This expansion reflects our core belief that **good tools should adapt to users, not the other way around**. Browser choice is often deeply personal - some users prefer Edge for its performance, others for its integration with Windows, and some simply because it's what they're most comfortable with.

By supporting multiple browsers, we're ensuring that more people can access the tools they need to maintain a clean, professional online presence.

## Looking Forward

Adding Edge support is just one step in our mission to make TikTok profile management accessible to everyone. We're committed to:

- **Listening to user feedback** and expanding to meet your needs
- **Maintaining the same high standards** across all platforms
- **Keeping your privacy and security** as our top priority
- **Providing consistent, reliable performance** regardless of browser choice

## Thank You to Our Community

This expansion wouldn't have happened without the persistent requests from our Edge-using community. Your feedback drives our development, and we're grateful for every message, comment, and suggestion that helped make this possible.

We're excited to welcome Edge users to the ClearTok family and look forward to helping even more people maintain clean, professional TikTok profiles.
